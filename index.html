	<h3><b>Our Vision</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	We strive for a world where lawyers can practice law independently to effectively fulfil their role in upholding the rule of law and the protection of human rights. Lawyers should be able to do their job without improper interference or any fear of reprisal. Always and everywhere. Also, when that does not suit the government, the bar association or the establishment.
	<br><br>When we work to promote and protect the independence of lawyers, we are committed to:
	<ul class="list">
		<li>Put lawyers under threat at the heart of our work;</li>
		<li>Provide support to meet expressed needs by lawyers whose rights are violated;</li>
		<li>Analyse why lawyers face reprisals, guided by local lawyers and other stakeholders;</li>
		<li>Identify the most effective ways to achieve tangible impact and lasting progress;</li>
		<li>Act independently, objectively, professionally, and with integrity;</li>
		<li>Act in coordination and solidarity with other actors working toward common goals.</li>
	</ul></p>
